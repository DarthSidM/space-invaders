## Overview

Space Invaders is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a spaceship that must defend Earth from invading aliens. The game features multiple levels with increasing difficulty, various types of enemy ships, and power-ups to aid the player.

This version of Space Invaders is implemented in Python using the Pygame library.

## Features

- **Shooting**: Press the spacebar key to shoot lasers at the invading aliens.
- **Alien Enemies**: Defend Earth from waves of alien invaders descending from the top of the screen. Be careful, as they move faster and become more aggressive with each level.
- **Power-ups**: power-ups such as bigger bullets or extra lives can be earned or used, providing temporary advantages to the player.
- **Scoring**: Earn points for each alien destroyed. Score extra points by defeating boss aliens or completing bonus objectives.
